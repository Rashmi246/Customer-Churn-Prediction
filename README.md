# Customer Churn Prediction

- The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn.
- Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along with information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and online security), I have tried to build a model that helps the company identify customers who are at a high risk of churning.
- By predicting customer churn, the company can proactively design retention strategies to keep these customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing financial loss.
